                The answer to your question depends on the license that you
                applied to your work. Your post doesn't indicate, but since you
                have a relatively small number if GitHub repositories I took a
                look. Some of your repos have no license specified, some have
                the MIT license, and 1 the Apache license. Here's a bit of an
                answer for all 3 cases. Case 1: no license specified.
                Technically, if you have not specified a license, and have also
                not explicitly put the work into the public domain, then nobody
                but you can legally make a copy. Whether you have explicitly
                stated this anywhere or not, this case is essentially a
                copyright with all rights reserved. If this is your intention
                then it should probably be a private repository. People fork and
                clone public repos all the time including those without licenses
                stated. Many mistakenly think no license means public domain
                which it does not. Case 2: MIT license. This is an
                all-permissive license. It allows others to do almost anything
                with your code. They can copy it as is. They can use it in
                closed source commercial software. They can change it. They can
                give it away for free with or without changes. They can sell it
                with or without changes. And so on and so forth. The only
                requirement is that they keep the copyright notice and license
                notice in tact in any copies they distribute including in
                "substantial portions". However, they can redistribute it with
                or without changes under whatever license they want. The main
                purpose of requiring keeping the notice is so that others know
                how that portion was originally licensed. They can copy
                non-substantial portions without including your copyright notice
                and license notice.

                The answer to your question depends on the license that you
                applied to your work. Your post doesn't indicate, but since you
                have a relatively small number if GitHub repositories I took a
                look. Some of your repos have no license specified, some have
                the MIT license, and 1 the Apache license. Here's a bit of an
                answer for all 3 cases. Case 1: no license specified.
                Technically, if you have not specified a license, and have also
                not explicitly put the work into the public domain, then nobody
                but you can legally make a copy. Whether you have explicitly
                stated this anywhere or not, this case is essentially a
                copyright with all rights reserved. If this is your intention
                then it should probably be a private repository. People fork and
                clone public repos all the time including those without licenses
                stated. Many mistakenly think no license means public domain
                which it does not. Case 2: MIT license. This is an
                all-permissive license. It allows others to do almost anything
                with your code. They can copy it as is. They can use it in
                closed source commercial software. They can change it. They can
                give it away for free with or without changes. They can sell it
                with or without changes. And so on and so forth. The only
                requirement is that they keep the copyright notice and license
                notice in tact in any copies they distribute including in
                "substantial portions". However, they can redistribute it with
                or without changes under whatever license they want. The main
                purpose of requiring keeping the notice is so that others know
                how that portion was originally licensed. They can copy
                non-substantial portions without including your copyright notice
                and license notice.
